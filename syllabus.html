<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>

<p>The learning goals describe what we want students to know or be able to do by the end of the semester. We evaluate whether learning goals have been achieved through assignments, in-class discussion and exercises, exams, and the final project.  These goals are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Students will learn to use abstract interpretation to formally prove that an analysis is sound and will terminate.  They will also learn to analyze the scalability of a program analysis and compare the precision of different analysis techniques.</li>
  <li>Students will learn to implement program analyses that verify program properties and find bugs using dataflow analysis, interprocedural analysis, alias analysis, and symbolic execution.  Furthermore, they will learn how program analysis frameworks can leverage abstract interpretation ideas in order to reuse the vast majority of analysis boilerplate.</li>
</ul>

The course will also teach more general, transferrable skills in computer science.  These include:

<ul>
  <li>The ability to reason rigorously about what code does</li>
  <li>The ability to formally model discrete software systems and prove theorems about those models</li>
  <li>The ability to build moderate-scale programs using software frameworks</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>15-251 and (15-150 or 15-214)</p>

  <!-- TODO: specify in more detail, as appropriate.  Below is a 15-214 example
  <ul>
    <li>The equivalent of 2 semester-long programming classes<br>
    </li>
    <li>Ability to write small programs in C (or Java, C#, or other
imperative languages with pointers or references)<br>
    </li>
    <li>Ability to reason about programs using preconditions,
postconditions, and invariants</li>
    <li>Familiarity with a basic set of algorithms and data structures
(linked lists, simple graph and sorting algorithms)<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  -->

<hr />

<h3>Computer Science and Software Engineering Requirements Fulfilled</h3>

<p>This course can be used to satisfy the Logic and Languages constrained elective category of the Computer Science Bachelor's Degree.
The course is also preapproved for the Theoretical Foundations requirement of the Computer Science master's degree.
It also satisfies the Technical Software Engineering requirement for the Software Engineering minor, subject to double-counting rules.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="evaluation">Assessments</h3>
<p>The final course grade will be calculated using the following categories and percentages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>40% assignments</li>
  <li>25% midterm exam</li>
  <li>20% final project</li>
  <li>15% exercises and in-class participation</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Assignments</b> are a mixture of formal definitions and proofs covering analysis theory, and programming exercises that cover the principled construction of program analyses.  Both forms of assignments will be assessed based on correctness and clarity of the definitions and of the analysis implementation, respectively.</p>

<p>The <b>midterm exam</b> will be given in-class.  It is a closed-book exam.  The exam will be designed so that a well-prepared student can complete it within the 80-minute class period.  As time pressure is not the point of the exam, the instructors will make arrangements for students to take extra time after the class period if needed.</p>

<p>The <b>final project</b> will be a student-selected analysis implementation project.  It will be assessed similar to a programming assignment.  Ph.D. students (and other students, at their option) take on a project of larger scope that is expected to engage with research; in turn, they are not required to complete the last ordinary assignment.</p>

<p><b>Class participation and readings</b> are important, as most material will be communicated via lectures or readings and reinforced with in-class activities.  In most class periods there will be an in-class exercise designed to allow students to practice the material being taught.  Students will earn one participation point for completing each day's in-class exercise (regardless of the answers given).  When there is no in-class exercise, participation will be assessed via a sign-in sheet.  Students can miss up to 2 days of class or recitation without losing any participation credit.

Expections for readings differ between the Ph.D. (17-819) and masters/undergraduate (17-355/17-665) versions of the course.  Masters and undergraduate students are expected to achieve a high-level understanding of the readings, whereas Ph.D. students will be expected to master more details.  Understanding of the readings will be assessed with online quizzes.

<p>We anticipate that letter grades will be assigned based on the following percentages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>90-100% A</li>
  <li>80-89% B</li>
  <li>70-79% C</li>
  <li>60-69% D</li>
  <li>0-59% R</li>
</ul>

<p>The instructors reserve the right to adjust these percentages downward if, in his view, the revision would better reflect student mastery of the learning goals in the class.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="textbooks">Supplemental Textbook</h3>

<p>The primary reference for this course is the instructors' course notes.  For those who would like to have a second textbook as a reference, the course schedule indicates when certain topics are covered in the supplemental text.  These readings are <strong>optional</strong> but we provide them for those who would like a second reference.  The supplemental text is:</p>

<p>Nielson, Nielson, and Hankin. <a href="http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/%7Eriis/PPA/ppa.html">Principles of Program Analysis</a> (PPA).</p>

<hr />

<h3>Time Management</h3>

<p>
This is a 12-unit course, and it is our intention to manage it so that
you spend close to 12 hours a week on the course, on average. In
general, 4 hours/week will be spent in class and 8 hours on
assignments. Please feel free to give the course staff feedback
on how much time the course is taking for you.
</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="late-work">Late Work Policy</h3>
<p>
We understand that normal life events, including projects and exams in other
courses and technical difficulties out of your control, can interfere with 
your ability to complete your work on time. 
Our philosophy is that our late work policy includes built-in 
flexibility but that the policy will be uniformly applied to all students
in all circumstances.
Exceptions to this policy will be made only in extraordinary circumstances,
almost always involving a family or medical emergency with 
your academic advisor or the Dean of Student Affairs requesting the 
exception on your behalf.  
</p>

<p>
For most homework deadlines you may turn in your work up to five days late
using (1) free late days (see below) or (2) 10% per day penalties.
<strong>Work turned in more than five days late will receive feedback but no 
credit, i.e., a 100% penalty.</strong>
</p>


<p>
Each student starts the semester with <strong>five free late days</strong>
which will automatically be applied to your
assignments until you have used all five free late days.  A late day is
automatically applied when your work is late; you may not 
defer a free late day to be used on a later assignment.
</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="collaboration">Collaboration Policy</h3>

We expect that your work on assignments, projects, and exams will be
your own work.
Thus, you may not copy any part of a solution to a problem that was
written by another student, or was developed together with another
student, or was copied from another unauthorized source such as the
Internet. You may not look at another student's solution, even if
you have completed your own, nor may you knowingly give your solution
to another student or leave your solution where another student can see
it.
</p>

<p>
Here are some examples of behavior that are inappropriate:
<ul>
<li> Copying files or parts of files (such as source code, written text, or unit tests) from another person or source.
<li> Copying (or retyping) files or parts of files with minor modifications such as style changes or minor logic modifications.
<li> Allowing someone else to copy your code or written assignment, either in draft or final form.
<li> Getting help that you do not fully understand, and from someone whom you do not acknowledge on your solution.
<li> Writing, using, or submitting a program that attempts to alter or erase grading information or otherwise compromise security of course resources.
<li> Copying someone else's files containing draft solutions, even if the file permissions are incorrectly set to allow it.
<li> Lying to course staff.
<li> Copying prose or programs directly.
<li> Giving copies of work to others.
<li> Making your work publicly available in a way that other students (current or future) can access your solutions, even if others’ access is accidental or incidental to your goals.
<li> Coaching others step-by-step without them understanding your help.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
If any of your work contains any statement that was not
written by you, you must put it in quotes and cite the source. If you
are paraphrasing an idea you read elsewhere, you must acknowledge the
source. Using existing material without proper citation is
plagiarism, a form of cheating. If there is any question about
whether
the material is permitted, you must get permission in advance. We
will be using automated systems to detect software plagiarism.
</p>
<p>
It is not considered cheating to clarify vague points in the
assignments, lectures, lecture notes, or to give help or receive help
in using the computer systems, compilers, debuggers, profilers, or
other facilities.
</p>
<p>
Some assignments are specifically noted as group projects. For
these, interpret "you" in the preceeding paragraphs to mean "you and
your partner(s)."
</p>
<p>
Any violation of this policy
is cheating. The minimum penalty for cheating (including
plagiarism) will be a zero
grade for the whole assignment. Cheating incidents will also be
reported through University channels, with possible additional
disciplinary action. For more information, see the <a
 href="http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/Academic%20Integrity.htm">University Policy on Academic Integrity</a>.  There is no statute of limitations for violations of the collaboration policy; penalties may be assessed (and referred to the university disciplinary board) after you have completed the course, and some requirements of the collaboration policy (such as restrictions on you posting your solutions) extend beyond your completion of the course.<br>
</p>

<p>
If you have any question about how this policy
applies in a particular situation, ask the instructors or TAs for
clarification.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Electronics Policy</h3>

<p>Educational research indicates that the use of electronic devices in typical classroom situations detracts from learning.  Thus, to enhance your learning and that of others in the class, and to encourage active class participation, we generally do not allow the use of electronic devices during lectures.  If you have a working style that relies on electronic devices, or need to use them for some other reason, please talk with the instructors.

<p> Many of the recitation exercises rely on laptops, so we encourage students to bring their laptops to recitation section.

<hr />

<h3 id="collaboration">Accommodations</h3>

<p>If you have a disability and require
accommodations, please contact Catherine Getchell, Director of Disability Resources, 412-268-6121,
<a href="mailto:getchell@cmu.edu">getchell@cmu.edu</a>. If you have an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources office, I encourage
you to discuss your accommodations and needs with me as early in the semester as possible. I will work
with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="collaboration">Your health matters</h3>

<p>When we say "your health matters" we mean exactly that:  Your health matters.  We don't intend to imply that other peoples' health does not matter, or that your health matters more or less than theirs.  It's just that we know that CMU can be a stressful, risky environment, and <em>your</em> health is the health that is relevant in this conversation.</p>

<p><strong>Please take care of yourself</strong>.  Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress.</p>

<p>All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful.</p>

<p>If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is here to help: call 412-268-2922 and visit their website at <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/">http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/</a>.  Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support that can help.</p>
