<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>

<p>The learning goals describe what we want students to know or be able to do by
  the end of the semester. We evaluate whether learning goals have been achieved
  through assignments, in-class discussion and exercises, exams, and the final
  project.  These goals are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Students will learn to implement program analyses that verify program
  properties and find bugs using dataflow analysis, interprocedural analysis,
  pointer analysis, Hoare logic, symbolic execution, and dynamic 
  analysis.  Furthermore, they will learn how
  program analysis frameworks can leverage abstract interpretation ideas in
  order to reuse the vast majority of analysis boilerplate.</li>
  <li>Students will learn to use abstract interpretation to formally prove that
  an analysis is sound and will terminate.  They will also learn to analyze the
  scalability of a program analysis and compare the precision of different
  analysis techniques.</li>
</ul>

The course will also teach more general, transferrable skills in computer science.  These include:

<ul>
  <li>The ability to reason rigorously about what code does.</li>
  <li>The ability to formally model discrete software systems and prove theorems about those models.</li>
  <li>The ability to build moderate-scale programs using software frameworks.</li>
  <li>The ability to run large, existing open-source tools.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="evaluation">Assessments</h3>
<p>The final course grade will be calculated using the following categories and percentages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>40% homework assignments</li>
  <li>25% one midterm exam</li>
  <li>20% final project</li>
  <li>15% exercises and in-class participation</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Assignments</b> are a mixture of formal definitions/proofs covering
analysis theory and programming exercises that cover the principled
construction of program analyses.  Both forms of assignments will be assessed
based on correctness and clarity of the definitions and of the analysis
implementation, respectively. </p>
<p>Assignments will be submitted via <a href="https://www.github.com">Github</a>, 
<a href="https://www.gradescope.com/">Gradescope</a>, and/or <a href="https://canvas.cmu.edu/">Canvas</a>, 
as appropriate.</p>

<p>There will be one open-book <b>midterm exam</b>.<!--, which will be given as a take-home assignment. -->
The exam will be designed so that a well-prepared student can complete them within
the 80-minute class period.  As time pressure is not the point of the exam, the
instructors will make arrangements for students to take extra time after the
class period if needed.</p>

<p>The <b>semester project</b> will be student-selected.  Students will have
  several options:
<ul>
<li>A student-defined analysis implementation or other research
  project.  This is the default assumed project for enrolled Ph.D. students, who
  are generally expected to take on a project of larger scope that engages with
  (typically their) research.</li>
<li>A student-selected, but instructor-guided program analysis-related project
  with a research angle.  This option is intended to provide guidance for
  typically non-PhD students who would like to explore program analysis research
  but do not yet have sufficient exposure to research to define their own
  project.</li>
<li>A substantive pull request contributing to a real-world program analysis tool
  or framework.</li>
<li>A substantive analysis implementation project.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to code and a write-up, the projects will involve a <i>checkpoint
report</i> (intended to overview the background on the project in question and
establish progress, guidelines to be provided) and a <i>final presentation</i>,
describing what the student(s) actually did/accomplished. 

<p>Students will be permitted (but not required) to work with partners for the
final project; we expect partnered projects to be larger in scope than solo
projects.  Graduate (PhD) students are expected to take on projects of
non-trivial, research-oriented scope, regardless of whether they work alone or
in pairs.</p>

<p><b>Class participation and readings</b> are important, as most material will
be communicated via lectures or readings and reinforced with in-class
activities. In most class periods there will be an in-class exercise designed to
allow students to practice the material being taught. Students will earn one
participation point for completing each day's in-class exercise (regardless of
the answers given). When there is no in-class exercise, participation will be
assessed via a sign-in sheet. Students missing class due to unavoidable circumstances
(e.g. health or family-related matters) can make up participation points
by attending the instructor's office hours after having read the lecture notes for
this missed class, coming with a couple of questions or comments prepared for 
discussion.

<!-- <p><b>Illness.</b> In particular, please don't come to class sick! Email the
instructor if you're unwell; this counts as an excused absence.   -->

<h3 id="textbooks">Supplemental Textbook</h3>

<p>The primary reference for this course are the provided 
<a href="resources/program-analysis.pdf">course notes</a>.  For
those who would like to have a second textbook as a reference, the course
schedule indicates when certain topics are covered in the supplemental text.
These readings are <strong>optional</strong> but we provide them for those who
would like a second reference.  The supplemental text is:</p>

<p>Nielson, Nielson, and
Hankin. <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-662-03811-6">Principles of
Program Analysis</a> (PPA).</p>

<hr />

<h3>Time Management</h3>

<p>
This is a 12-unit course, and it is my intention to manage it so that
you spend close to 12 hours a week on the course, on average. In
general, 4 hours/week will be spent in class and 8 hours on
assignments. Please feel free to give the course staff feedback
on how much time the course is taking for you.
</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="late-work">Late Work Policy</h3>

<p>
We understand that normal life events, including projects and exams in other
courses and technical difficulties out of your control, can interfere with your
ability to complete your work on time.  Our philosophy is that our late work
policy includes built-in flexibility but that the policy will be uniformly
applied to all students.  Exceptions to this policy will be made only in
extraordinary circumstances, almost always involving a family or medical
emergency with your academic advisor or the Dean of Student Affairs
requesting such exceptions on your behalf.
</p>

<p>
For most homework deadlines, you may turn in your work up to three days late. You
begin the semester with <strong>five free late days</strong>.  These are
automatically applied to late assignments until they are all expended.  You
cannot defer a free late day from one assignment to another.  Once late days are
expended, a 10% (full letter grade) penalty applies per-day.  Work turned in
more than three days late will receive feedback but no credit, i.e., a 100%
penalty, regardless of late day application/availability.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="collaboration">Collaboration Policy</h3>

We expect that your work on individual assignments, projects, and exams will be
your own work.  Thus, you may not copy any part of a solution to a problem that
was written by another student, or was developed together with another student,
or was copied from another unauthorized source such as the Internet. You may not
look at another student's solution, even if you have completed your own, nor may
you knowingly give your solution to another student or leave your solution where
another student can see it.
</p>

<p>
Here are some examples of behavior that are inappropriate:
<ul>
<li> Copying files or parts of files (such as source code, written text, or unit tests) from another person or source.
<li> Copying (or retyping) files or parts of files with minor modifications such as style changes or minor logic modifications.
<li> Allowing someone else to copy your code or written assignment, either in draft or final form.
<li> Getting help that you do not fully understand, and from someone whom you do not acknowledge on your solution.
<li> Writing, using, or submitting a program that attempts to alter or erase grading information or otherwise compromise security of course resources.
<li> Copying someone else's files containing draft solutions, even if the file permissions are incorrectly set to allow it.
<li> Lying to course staff.
<li> Copying prose or programs directly.
<li> Giving copies of work to others.
<li> Making your work publicly available in a way that other students (current or future) can access your solutions, even if others' access is accidental or incidental to your goals.
<li> Coaching others step-by-step without them understanding your help.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
If any of your work contains any statement that was not
written by you, you must put it in quotes and cite the source. If you
are paraphrasing an idea you read elsewhere, you must acknowledge the
source. Using existing material without proper citation is
plagiarism, a form of cheating. If there is any question about
whether
the material is permitted, you must get permission in advance. We
will be using automated systems to detect software plagiarism.
</p>
<p>
It is not considered cheating to clarify vague points in the
assignments, lectures, lecture notes, or to give help or receive help
in using the computer systems, compilers, debuggers, profilers, or
other facilities.
</p>
<p>
Some assignments are specifically noted as group projects. For
these, interpret "you" in the preceeding paragraphs to mean "you and
your partner(s)."
</p>
<p>
Any violation of this policy
is cheating. The minimum penalty for cheating (including
plagiarism) will be a zero
grade for the whole assignment. Cheating incidents will also be
reported through University channels, with possible additional
disciplinary action. For more information, see the <a
 href="https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html">University Policy on Academic Integrity</a>.  There is no statute of limitations for violations of the collaboration policy; penalties may be assessed (and referred to the university disciplinary board) after you have completed the course, and some requirements of the collaboration policy (such as restrictions on you posting your solutions) extend beyond your completion of the course.<br>
</p>

<p>
If you have any question about how this policy
applies in a particular situation, ask the instructors or TAs for
clarification.

<h3 id="accomodations">Accommodations</h3>

<p>If you have a disability and require
accommodations, please contact Catherine Getchell, Director of Disability Resources, 412-268-6121,
<a href="mailto:getchell@cmu.edu">getchell@cmu.edu</a>. If you have an
accommodations letter from the Disability Resources office, We encourage you to
discuss your accommodations and needs with me as early in the semester as
possible. We will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as
appropriate.</p>

<!-- Hidden for COVID. Restore in future.


<h3>Electronics Policy</h3>

<p>Educational research indicates that the use of electronic devices in typical
classroom situations detracts from learning.  Thus, to enhance your learning and
that of others in the class, and to encourage active class participation, we
generally do not allow the use of electronic devices during lectures.  I make
exceptions by request (no reason/explanation required), but ask that those who
use electronics ensure they stay focused on course materials.

<p> Many of the recitation exercises rely on laptops, so we encourage students
to bring their laptops to recitation section.
-->

<h3>Pandemic Mode</h3>

<p>This class is designated as <em>in-person expected</em>. However, as per university guidelines and in response to rapidly changing situations related to the COVID-19 pandemic, some classes, recitations, and office hours, may be conducted remotely via Zoom. Watch out for announcements on the <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/coronavirus/index.html">CMU COVID-19 website</a> or on Piazza for such information.</p>

<p>Homework assignments, in-class exercises, and the mid-term exam will be distributed electronically. If you are attending lectures in-person, we encourage you to bring your laptop to class to access these resources as needed. If you need physical copies, please let us know in advance. During lecture, you should not use your laptops for activities unrelated to the course.</p>

<p>At any point during the semester, if you are feeling sick and/or are exhibiting any symptoms of COVID-19, please do not come to class. Do reach out to the instructors if you require any unanticipated health-related accommodations.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="collaboration">Your health matters</h3>

<p>When we say "your health matters" we mean exactly that:  Your health matters.  We don't intend to imply that other peoples' health does not matter, or that your health matters more or less than theirs.  It's just that we know that CMU can be a stressful, risky environment, and <em>your</em> health is the health that is relevant in this conversation.</p>

<p><strong>Please take care of yourself</strong>.  Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress.</p>

<p>All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful.</p>

<p>If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is here to help: call 412-268-2922 and visit their website at <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/">http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/</a>.  Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support that can help.</p>
